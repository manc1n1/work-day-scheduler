https://manc1n1.github.io/work-day-scheduler

## Description

A work day scheduler using Day.js API that allows you to view the current day along with any event you have scheduled within that day from 9am to 5pm and updates based on local time. Past, present, and future events are viewed with ease via color coded time-blocks. You can save new events during a time-block. Each time-block is 1 hour. Refreshing the page will load all events from local storage.

## Usage

Click a time-block and type a message describing what you are doing within that hour. Click the blue save button on the right of the corresponding time-block to save your message.
