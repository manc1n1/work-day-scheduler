## Description

A work day scheduler using Day.js API that allows you to view the current day along with any event you have scheduled within that day from 9am to 5pm and updates based on time zones. You can save new events during that time block. Each time block is 1 hour. Refreshing the page will load all events due to local storage.

## Usage

Click a time block and type a message describing what you are doing within that hour. Hit the blue save button on the right of the time block to save your message.
